# OldBedFixWithRemote
A relative of mine has an old bed that has a controller that is connected with a wire to the bed. The wires broke, so they asked me if I could take a look. After a while I came up with an idea that involved a small Arduino, to control the bed, and an Android app
 that would control the Arduino from a phone.
